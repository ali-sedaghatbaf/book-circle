## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    First, install the necessary project dependencies using npm.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. You will need to add your Google AI API key to this file to enable the AI features.
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key_here"
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Servers:**
    The application requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI backend. Open two separate terminal windows for the following commands.

    - **Terminal 1: Run the Next.js App**
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
      This will start the web application on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

    - **Terminal 2: Run the Genkit AI Server**
      ```bash
      npm run genkit:watch
      ```
      This will start the Genkit development server, which handles the AI flows.

    You should now be able to access the application in your browser!
